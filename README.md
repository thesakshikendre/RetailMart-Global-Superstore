# RetailMart Global Superstore – Power BI Portfolio Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This is an end-to-end Power BI portfolio project built using the Global Superstore dataset.
The goal is to progressively learn and apply Power BI concepts, starting from basic data
import and DAX, and moving toward advanced analytics and dashboard design.

This project is inspired by real-world retail dashboards (Amazon-style) and focuses on
clear business insights rather than just visuals.
